<h2> Our School</h2>
<h3><p>As you have already figured out by reading the other
  paragraphs, my sister and I go to a school named Mary Shadd
  Public School.<br><br>It is a school in Toronto, Canada. 
  Mary Shadd is a school over 35 years old! Mary Shadd Public
  School got its name by a person named Mary Ann Shadd who 
  helped<br><br>african slaves to come to Canada across the American 
  border using the Underground Railroad. That's why the school's
  logo has a train to represent the Underground Railroad even though
  there is no train. They have many banners won by student who 
  competed competitively. Scroll down to learn about my hobbies.

<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
<h3><p>My hobbies are playing sports. My favourite
  sports are Basketball, Soccer, and now Flag 
  Football too. As you heard in the last paragraph,<br><br>
  there are competitive team tryouts for sports at
  my school. I went to all 3 tryouts for Flag Football
  because it seemed fun and, I made the team!<br><br>
  Plus, my coach put me as the quarterback position because
  he wanted me to take the leading position and I was 
  so excited.<br><br>The tournament is on a school day and 
  my coach told my team that we would be skipping 
  the whole day of school. <br><br>Everyday we will be practicing
  to attempt to be the city champions.<br><br> I am nervous because
  I will be representing the school. I believe I am ready though.
